# M7 W2 M3a -- THE GATES, in SIX lock segments so the harness lane's own cells
# can interleave between them.
#
#   G1  Debug: fresh configure, build, suite WITHOUT the >600 s test
#   G2  the >600 s test ALONE (Continuation.ProbeBudgetBoundsAFailingProposal)
#   G3  Release: fresh configure (the bench binaries carry a configure-time
#       git-describe, so a stamped leg re-configures), build, suite
#   G4  the U0 27-cell three-arm replay against the M6 close pin
#   G5  P-SYM, Release and Debug, classified against $BEFORE with THIS round's
#       own changed-header list
#   G6  install smoke, the export contract (three arguments), clang-format,
#       git diff --check
#
# Exit 1 from P-SYM is EXPECTED -- one field on SqpCounters moves sizeof
# 848 -> 856 in every TU that lays the struct out -- and the gate is the
# CLASSIFICATION, which must report 0 unexplained.
#
# =========================================================================
# M7 W2 M3b TASK A RUNS THIS FILE. It is M3a fix round 1's `gates-fix1.sh`,
# copied and re-pointed: `$BEFORE`, the expected test counts, the expected
# P-SYM mover shape, the classifier and asserts copies, the artifact directory
# and the scratch tree. M3a's own `gates.sh` and `gates-fix1.sh` are NOT edited
# -- they produced committed transcripts and a gate's evidence must stay
# reproducible from the script that produced it. The fix-round histories kept
# below are M2b's and M3a's, not this task's; they are kept because they say
# WHY each refusal exists.
#
# ---- THIS ROUND'S DECLARED EXPECTATIONS, AND WHERE THEY COME FROM ---------
#
# ALL OF THEM ARE DERIVED IN `gates/psym-derivation.txt`, committed BEFORE this
# chain was detached, and that file is the argument; what follows is the
# summary.
#
# TEST COUNTS. Baseline at `ea027804` (M3a fix round 1's head): Debug 2678 run
# with the long test excluded, Release 2679 run with everything. Nothing
# between `ea027804` and `9fee5545` touches a test -- `git log --name-only`
# over that range lists only `docs/notes/data/**` and the ledger. This task
# adds exactly ELEVEN TEST() blocks, all in the new `hven_qp_walk_seam_tests`
# executable, and changes none in place, so both numbers are +11: 2689 Debug,
# 2690 Release. CROSS-CHECKED: `ctest -N` reports 2692 on both of this task's
# own trees, and the two-test offset M2b fix1 derived in full (a CTest summary
# line counts the one SKIPPED test but not the two DISABLED ones) gives
# 2692 - 2 = 2690 Release and 2690 - 1 = 2689 Debug. The two agree.
#
# THE P-SYM MOVER SHAPE: ZERO, IN BOTH CONFIGURATIONS.
#
#   Release   DIFFERING 0 = class A 0 + class B 0
#   Debug     DIFFERING 0 = class A 0 + class B 0
#
# and therefore `psym_compare.sh compare` must exit 0, not 1. That is the one
# behavioural difference between `gate_asserts_m3b.sh` (version 3) and version
# 2 beside it in M3a's wrappers, and it is argued at its site.
#
# WHY ZERO IS THE HONEST PREDICTION rather than an optimistic one. Everything
# this task adds to compiled code is inside `#ifdef HVEN_TESTING`, which no
# target in the P-SYM capture set defines; the one `#include` it adds is placed
# in `qp_engine.h` rather than in `qp_engine.cpp` precisely so that the walk
# TU's own `assert()` keeps its `__LINE__` immediate; and the new test source
# belongs to `hven_qp_walk_seam_tests`, which `scripts/psym_compare.sh`
# deliberately does not capture (0 of its objects are in either arm's
# manifest -- MEASURED, not assumed). The derivation measured the whole thing
# end to end before this file was written: 146 = 146 objects on both arms in
# both configurations, 0 `DIFFERS` lines, 0 `RELOCATIONS` lines, UNEXPLAINED 0,
# negative control 70.
#
# A ZERO DECLARATION IS STRONGER, NOT WEAKER, and what could make a false zero
# pass is a capture that compared nothing. Three things stand against that and
# the gate asserts all three: both capture rcs with non-empty manifests, equal
# object counts on the two arms, and a negative control of 70 -- objects that
# DO include a changed header and are identical anyway. A 0 declaration with a
# 0 control fails.
#
# THE P-SYM NOISE THE DERIVATION FOUND AND THIS GATE DOES NOT ASSERT: Release
# reports 3 NOISE-ONLY objects and Debug 29, all with CHANGED 0 instructions.
# The three shared by both are the three bench targets carrying a
# `*_GIT_DESCRIBE` compile definition, and they differ because the `before` arm
# is a detached checkout and this task changes `tests/CMakeLists.txt`, so Ninja
# re-runs CMake and `git describe` answers differently. That is a property of
# the two-checkout method, not of this task's code, and it is not in the
# production library. Debug's other 26 are TUs including `qp_engine.h`, whose
# DWARF line programme moves by one line.
#
# This is an ASSERTION and not a floor: if the shape is anything else the gate
# FAILS and the shape is re-derived and declared again, never discovered.
